# Face-Lock
Face lock application which can process the entering of windows using your face! It's called "Codoffee Freeze Wall", The base code was for a startup called Codoffee Programming Group and since it's 1.3 release, It has developed by I.T.I Cloud API.

* There are 3 .py and .pyw files in the project one of the { setting.py } is the main one and uses for create .yml file { deep learning trained file } of your face and drag it for training your face for face lock. the seconde one { lock.py } uses for lock the device and detecting your face it can lock your device and whenever it had detected your face using imported datas from trained file { .yml file of your face } it will unlock your device. the third one { listener.py } will create an unlimit loop for that if you've pressed { Win + ~ } lock the camputer again and making defense protocol by detecting your face!

* you will need to install some libraries. and it is necessary to run the setting.py at first and train your face to the base code then the base code can recognize your face!
